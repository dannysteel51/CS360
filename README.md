Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

I created an inventory app to help keep track of items around the house/ classroom/ small store. The app was intended for those who need something simple, that can keep track of small inventories, and will inform the user when any one of the items has run out of stock. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I created a main screen that allowed the user's to login with a username and password. And on the same page, for ease of use, I included a register button as well. From here, I created an inventory grid/ list. At the onset, the list is empty, and a message is displayed showing just that. On this page, the user can choose to add a new item, increase/ decrease said item, or even rename it. These items will then show up in the inventory list. I tried to make the app as simple as possible, and one of the main things I thought I could do to accomplish this was to make the app as "small" as possible, meaning as few pages as possible. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The first thing I did, which was paramount in me being able to finish the app, was to design the UI. With UI in place, I was able to "visually" see the app and then figure out what I needed. With buttons in place, I was able to use onclick functionality to connect xml files with java classes where the engine of the app is. As far as designing and coding the functionality, I relied heavily on the zybooks teachings and examples. Many of the functions in the app relied on callback functions, and without them, the project as a whole would not have worked. I can see myself utilizing this knowledge to further my development in projects of my own. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Within Android Studio, I utlizaed the hybrid screen of design and code while working in the xml layout files. This allowed me to see the project as I was creating it, but also to see, in real time, if there were any errors. While working in this manner, I tried to work on my java classes one at a time, writing code and running it often to make sure the code was error free. I did this knowing that the code would slowly grow to contain several java files, all working together, and knew it could easily get out of control if I didn't take this slow approach. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Easily the hardest part was getting all the java and xml classes (UI and the code) to work together. I can't say how many times I ran into an issue where I wasn't calling the right function or the right INTENT to move to another class. To overcome these issues, as I said before, I took it slow, trying to work methodically but intentionally, while also going back and revisiting the zybooks examples. I can't say how great that information was. Also, things like Google, Stackoverflow and a few others were beyond helpful. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

While I finished the app, I can't say I am very comfortable with things like the grid/list and DB databases. To make the app work happened mostly through trial and error, seeing what works, going back and looking at examples of similar components and functions. In the end, I got it to mostly work. But I'm not competent with these ares just yet. But I am comfortable with xml layout files, creating UI, and the login/register screen. One of the first things that truly CLICKED into place for me was the onclick functionality and how it can be used to call functions in the java files, from there setting the INTENT to drive from one class to another.
